Frostyland is an **RPG action-adventure game** created by a team of five students from the University of Alicante as part of an **8-month-long Project-Based Learning (PBL) initiative**. The game showcases original concepts and features fully custom-made 2D and 3D assets, animations, and promotional materials. Built from the ground up, it is **programmed in C++** and powered by a **proprietary 3D engine developed specifically for this project**, offering compatibility with both Windows and Linux systems.
